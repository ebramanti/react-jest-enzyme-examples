# Jest/Enzyme/Snapshot Examples

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Quick Start

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

The above commands will install dependencies and start the app. To run tests, run `yarn test` on a separate command line.
